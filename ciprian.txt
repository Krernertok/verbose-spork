One nice thing about egotists: they don't talk about other people.
Lee's Law:
	Mother said there would be days like this,
	but she never said that there'd be so many!
When you don't know what to do, walk fast and look worried.
Better dead than mellow.
Boys are beyond the range of anybody's sure understanding, at least
when they are between the ages of 18 months and 90 years.
		-- James Thurber
